# Data Structure Project

## Overview
This project implements various fundamental data structures in Python, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 
Each data structure is encapsulated in its own module, providing a clear and organized structure for understanding and utilizing these data structures.
The project is based on what i am learning from a book about data structures

This has been made following grokking Data Structures by Marcello La Rocca
